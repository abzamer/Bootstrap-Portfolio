# Bootstrap-Portfolio
My portfolio using Bootstrap. In this portfolio, Bootstrap was used to recreate an earlier version done with HTML & CSS. While not all parts of this portfolio exactly matches the earlier version, all parts are included. 

## General info
The purpose of this portfolio was to become familiar with the use of Bootstrap in creating a portfolio, while attempting to match the previous version.
